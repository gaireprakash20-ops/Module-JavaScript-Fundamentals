// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
// The pad is called 3 times in step 15.

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The value which is assigned to num when pad is called for the first time is 0.
// c) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The value of pad when it is called for the first time "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The value assign to num is 1.
//  because the last call to pad is pad(remainingSeconds), and remainingSeconds is 1
// when formatTimeDisplay(61) is called.

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The return value is "01" because the last call to pad is pad(1).
// The pad function add a zero to make the number two digits.
